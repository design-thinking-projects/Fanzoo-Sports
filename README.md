# Fanzoo Sports
A redesigned concept of fantasy sports platform I worked on in my first job.

## Motivation
During my first job I was ammateur and inexperienced when used to work on this project, and also the startup shut down abruptly. Because of all these reasons I couldn't give shape to my vision of how product should be.

## Fanzoo Sports
Fanzoo was India's first promo-gaming company. The platform allowed Brands and Business to form an association with popular online fantasy games, which leads to guaranteed customer acquisition and customer engagement. The website and application was launched in December 2016 and had partnered with major brands like Zomato, Smaaash, Uber, Kingfisher, Social, and others.
